Zabipi
======
Zabipi - is a very simple and clear Zabbix API which allow you to use perl data structures to make JSON requests and to get answers.
Zabipi in functional is only one command "zbx" which prepare HTTP POST request, send it to server and parse results.
zbx has some subcommands, wich is divided to "simplified actions" (such as searchHostByName) and "native API methods" (such as user.get).

There are no documentation for Zabipi yet...
...except this README and INSTALL files, and the bunch of examples, of course :)

But if you can read in russian, it will be very helpful for you to read this forum thread, which is used by me as a something like 
"Changelog" with short usable examples:

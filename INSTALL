** Dependencies **
Monitoring::Zabipi has the following dependencies:
1) Date::Parse
Reason: used by queue.get native method
2) LWP::UserAgent
Reason: used to make POST requests to the Zabbix frontend
3) JSON
Reason: Used to assemble JSON-strings from Perl datastructures when making requests and to decompile JSON strings, received from the Zabbix frontend, to Perl datastructures

** Installation **
You have two different choices where to place Zabipi,pm
1) Make directory Monitoring in some "unusual" place
In this case you must add the directory in which you create the "Monitoring" subfolder to the @INC global array.
Doing so in your program simple as push @INC,$dir or unshift @INC,$dir ath the BEGIN block.
Refer to the Perl documentation to know how to do it globally.
2) Make directory Monitoring in the one of the directories, which already present in the @INC global array.
To view the contents of the @INC array, you may use this command:
perl -e 'print "  \@INC:\n\t".join("\n\t",@INC)."\n"'
or simple type perl -V (Look at the newline-separated list of directories right after "@INC:")

Than copy Zabipi.pm to the created/already existing Monitoring folder.

So if you prefer to not drop Monitoring::Zabipi to the one of your system pathes, you may use this code snippet:
---
BEGIN {
 unshift @INC, '/MONITORING/FOLDER/PATH';
}

use Monitoring::Zabipi qw(zbx zbx_last_err);
---

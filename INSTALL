** Dependencies **
Monitoring::Zabipi has the following dependencies:
1) Date::Parse
Reason: used by queue.get native method
2) LWP::UserAgent
Reason: used to make POST requests to the Zabbix frontend
3) JSON
Reason: Used to assemble JSON-strings from Perl datastructures when making requests and to decompile JSON strings, received from the Zabbix frontend, to Perl datastructures
4) JSON::XS
Reason: JSON pretty printing in debug mode (see flPrettyJSON flag description)

** Installation **
You have two different choices where to place Zabipi.pm
1) Make directory Monitoring in some "unusual" place
In this case you must add the directory containing the previously created "Monitoring" subfolder to the @INC global array.
Doing so in your program is as simple as push @INC,$dir or unshift @INC,$dir at the BEGIN block.
Refer to the Perl documentation to know how to do it globally and "permanently".
2) Make directory Monitoring in the one of the directories, which already are in the @INC global array.
To view the contents of the @INC array, you may use this command:
 perl -e 'print "  \@INC:\n\t".join("\n\t",@INC)."\n"'
or simply type perl -V and look at the newline-separated list of directories right after "@INC:"

After you have Monitoring folder, copy Zabipi.pm to it.

Example:
If you prefer to not drop Monitoring::Zabipi to the one of your system pathes, you may use this code snippet:
---
BEGIN {
 unshift @INC, '/MONITORING/FOLDER/PATH';
}

use Monitoring::Zabipi qw(zbx zbx_last_err);
---
